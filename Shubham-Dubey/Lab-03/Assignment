Experiment 3:
Develop and demonstrate a XHTML file that includes Javascript script that uses functions for the following
problems:

a) Parameter: A string
Output: The position in the string of the left-most vowel

b) Parameter: A number
Output: The number with its digits in the reverse order

Objective :-
To get acquainted with javascript procedures and usage of regular expressions in javascript.

Proceedure :-

Question 3a :-
1. Declare the script tag as text/javascript in the beginning of the <body> of html program
2. Get the string from the user using prompt()
3. Validate input string (should be only alphabets, a - z) using the regular expression “ /^[a-zA-Z]+$/ “
and alert the user for invalid input using alert()
4. Convert the string to lowercase using toLowerCase()
5.Use indexOf(<vowel>) for each vowel to get the position of the vowel in the string.
6. Print the leftmost vowel i.e., print the lowest index got from indexof()

Question 3b :-
1. Declare the script tag as text/javascript in the beginning of the <body> of html program
2. Get the number to be reversed from the user using prompt()
3. Validate input number (should be a positive number between 0 to 9) using the regular expression “
/^[0-9]+$/ “ and alert the user for invalid input using alert()
4. Reverse the number using modulus operation.
5. Use math.floor(number/10) to get the floor of number after division (used for reversing)
6. Display the reversed string using alert()
